## Sports Agents Application

The Sports Agents Application provides a way for users to  
access statistics about sports and compare players and teams. 
It has data across several sports.

Specifications: 
Users can upload data on sports players and sports teams either
manually through the command line, through a file, or by 
accessing data from the web via an API (possibly). This data 
includes player and team scores and rankings over time, team 
composition, player goals/points scored, and team scores at each 
game. Users will be able to examine their uploaded data through 
statistics about each player and team. They can compare players 
and teams against each other. The application can generate 
predictions for players and hypothetical teams based on exponential regression,
and different users can compare hypothetical teams against each other 
(a fantasty sports-style tournament). All data and generated 
statistics can be exported.
The application will extend to multiple sports, such as tennis which is
an individual sport with no teams so we will have an abstract Player class
with sportPlayers as child classes.
