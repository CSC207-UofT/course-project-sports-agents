## Sports Agents Application

The Sports Agents Application provides a way for users to  
access statistics about sports and compare players and teams. 
It has data across several sports.

Specifications: 
Users can upload data on sports players and sports teams either
manually through the command line, through a file, or by 
accessing data from the web via an API (possibly). This data 
includes player and team scores and rankings over time, team 
composition, player goals/points scored, and team scores at each 
game. Users will be able to examine their uploaded data through 
statistics about each player and team. They can compare players 
and teams against each other. The application can generate 
predictions for players and hypothetical teams. Additionally, the
user of the app can add members to the app. The user then can make
bets on the matches on the behalf of the members. Then each member
will have a history, outlining which matches they were able to predict
correctly.
The application will extend to multiple sports, which are TBD.
