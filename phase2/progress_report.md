All members continued working on previous code from phase 1 to improve readibility, refactor, and incorporate the recieved feedback. Similar to phase 0 and 1, the group has been having regular weekly meetings outside of our practical session, which has helped all group members stay updated. Based on the feedback after phase1, in order for our program to be used easier, we added some new features. 

Nazanin has worked on `GetList` for sports, players, and stats and `Search` so the user can know the available options for each and based on that, provide the arguments for a command.
