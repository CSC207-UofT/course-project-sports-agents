Question 2:

Write a paragraph about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific 
category such as "students" or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.

  Since our product is based around sports and betting, if we wanted to sell or license our program to customers, the target category of
  consumers would be people who like watching and betting on sports. The best option would be to market our program towards anyone within that category who would want
  to use any unique parts of our program. For example, sports fans that enjoy betting on baseball, tennis and hockey would be the best demographic for us to target since
  our program does is centered around betting and statistics for those three sports. If we added more sports in the future, we could change our marketing strategy to
  also target people that enjoy watching whatever sport we add.


Question 3:

Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. For example, a program that converts txt files 
to files that can be printed by a braille printer are less likely to be used by people who do not read braille.
