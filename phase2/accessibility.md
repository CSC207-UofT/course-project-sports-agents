## Question 1:

For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-5 sentences or point form notes explaining which features your program adhere to that principle.
If you do not have any such features you can either:

(a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to principle or

(b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.

Equitable use: 
Our program requires the user to type in keywords. In the future, we could implement multiple input sources. For example, we could allow the user to choose their commands (e.g. predict_player_stat, compare_player_stat, or get_player_stat) by clicking or typing. 

Flexiblity in use:
In the future, we could implement a "help" feature that allows users to get explanations on what a specific statistic means. If a user does not know what a specific statistic is, the user may not know if it is better for the player/team to have a higher or lower value associated with that statistic. For example, one possible statistic tennis players have is double faults; the "help" feature can allow the user to get an explanation on double faults that explains how having more double faults is not good. This "help" feature would allow users with no sports background to use and understand the information conveyed by our program. 

Simple and intuitive use: 
Our program adheres to the principle by providing detailed error messages if the user gives invalid input. Specifically, when the user wants to retrieve a 
statistic for a certain player, the user must input the sport name, the player name, the season, and the name of the statistic. However, if any of this information
is invalid (not supported by our app), the app will tell the user which piece of information was incorrect. 

Perceptible infromation: 


Tolerance for error:
Our program does not any contain hazardous elements

Low physical effort:
Our program only requires the user to type in keywords. However, to minimize the amount of typing, we could implement a GUI in the future. Instead of having the user type in the needed keywords, the user can interct with icons or buttons that allow the user to select what command they are interested in.

Size and space for approach and use: 
Our program only requires that the user can see their computer screen and access their keyboard (to type in commands) 


## Question 2:

Write a paragraph about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific 
category such as "students" or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.

  Since our product is based around sports and betting, if we wanted to sell or license our program to customers, the target category of
  consumers would be people who like watching and betting on sports. The best option would be to market our program towards anyone within that category who would want
  to use any unique parts of our program. For example, sports fans that enjoy betting on baseball, tennis and hockey would be the best demographic for us to target since
  our program is centered around betting and statistics for those three sports. If we added more sports in the future, we could change our marketing strategy to
  also target people that enjoy watching whatever sports we add.


## Question 3:

Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. For example, a program that converts txt files 
to files that can be printed by a braille printer are less likely to be used by people who do not read braille.

  Similarly to question 2, since our program is based around sports and betting, someone who does not have any interest in sports would would be much less likely to use our
  program. Though someone without any interest in betting would still enjoyed watching sports may use our program to look through statistics and other information, they
  could still use that part of our program, just not the betting.
