# Progress Report

## Open questions your group is struggling with

## What has worked well so far with your design
We were able to expand our program to another sport, baseball. Similar to
Hockey and Tennis, we got a csv file for baseball players and made new classes
for getting stats, comparing, and predicting. We were also able to save the loaded
csv files and passes them so that there won't be any need to reload them. Additionally, 
by implementing new abstract classes we have greatly reduced redundat code. Establishing
these heirarchies in our classes has also made it easier to expand our program to include
other sports. Moreover, similar to our success with the Command design pattern in Phase 0, 
implementing the facade design pattern was very successful in Phase 1. Using the facade
design pattern has allowed us to easily incorporate the use case classes for all three
sports in the CommandManager class.

## A summary of what each group member has been working on and plans to work on next Presentation

Nazanin has worked on baseball stat manager, comparer, and predictor. She has also worked on DataContainer
for teams and players which demonstrates some form of data persistence.
