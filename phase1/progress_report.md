# Progress Report

## Open questions your group is struggling with

## What has worked well so far with your design
We were able to expand our program to another sport, baseball. Similar to
Hockey and Tennis, we got a csv file for baseball players and made new classes
for getting stats, comparing, and predicting. We were also able to save the loaded
csv files and passes them so that there won't be any need to reload them.

## A summary of what each group member has been working on and plans to work on next Presentation
Nazanin has worked on baseball stat manager, comparer, and predictor. She has also worked on DataContainer
for teams and players which demonstrates some form of data persistence.
