# Progress Report
The report should include:
- a brief summary of your specification, CRC model, scenario walk-through, and skeleton program,
- open questions your group is struggling with,
- what has worked well so far with your design,
- and a brief summary of what each group member has been working on and plans to work on next.


Brief summary of what each group member has been working on:
We have all been working on the CRC cards as well as example use cases for our application. We have been working on these together during our meetings, as well as separately throughout the week. If someone had an addition to make, we would make sure to first discuss this on Discord through texting.

After our second meeting on Friday 8th October, we assigned each person a section of a project in order to create our skeleton project. Karim started working on the CommandManager as well as the main method. Isaiah began working on the Member class to allow the main user to add members to their list. Nazanin began implementing the PlayerStatManager, and other player-focused stat classes, like predictor, and comparer. Samuel started working on the TeamStatManager to allow the user to get statistical data for teams. Vishali focused on working on the Player and Team classes, which will store the necessary data to make statistical manipulations possible. Finally, Jack started working on the Match class, so that the user can make games and have the members make bets on them.
