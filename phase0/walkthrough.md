Scenario: the user compares two teams and makes a prediction

The user can import data from a .csv file into the app. The app will load the data and create teams as specified by 
the .csv file. The user can then easily access different stats about the team for a given season/competition/year.  For 
example, if the user wanted to know how many games a hockey team has participated in for a specific season, the app 
can be used to retrieve the number of games that team has participated in for the given season. Additionally, when 
given two or more teams the app will provide the user with data that will make it easy and intuitive to compare the 
teams. For example, if the user wants to compare four hockey teams, and he/she wants to know which team participated 
in the most number of games for a given season, the app can be used to report the four hockey teams listed in 
non-increasing order based on the number of games played. Finally, the app can also be used to make predictions about 
a stat for a specific team, based on historical data for that team. For example, if the app contained data about a 
hockey team, including how many goals that team scored in 5 past seasons, it can then estimate/predict how many goals 
that team will score in an upcoming season (using linear regression).

After viewing stats about specific teams as explained, the user can then make their own prediction on who will win in 
a match between two teams of their choice. After making a decision on who will win, the user will create a match in the 
app, add themselves as a member of the fantasy league, and bet on the outcome of the match. Additionally, the user will 
add their friend as a member of the fantasy league and make a prediction on the same match on their behalf. After the
match ends, the user will indicate the outcome of the match in the app, and the app will determine which members got 
the predictions right and which didn't.
