## Sports Agents Application

The Sports Agents Application provides a way for users to  
access statistics about sports and compare players and teams. 

Specifications: 
Users can upload data on sports players and teams either
manually through the command line, through a file, or by 
accessing data from the web via an API (possibly). This data 
includes a variety of data on teams and players, such as the 
amount of points a team/Player has, or other statistical information about them.
Users will be able to examine this data in detail through the app. They can compare players 
and teams with each other, as well as examine each Player/team individually. This specific data can be exported
as a spreadsheet for the user to easily send someone the information or see it in a different format. The application 
can generate predictions for players and hypothetical teams based on different kinds of models and data, in order to 
provide the user with a holistic prediction. 

Additionally, the user of the app can add members to the app; these members are part of the fantasy 
betting league of the user, who is the manager of said league. The user
then can make bets on upcoming matches on the behalf of the members. Each
member will have a history, outlining which matches they were able to 
predict correctly. This will allow the league to have a ranking, and members can compete with each other
using the app. The aforementioned matches will be added by the user of the app.
The application will extend to multiple sports, such as tennis, hockey, as well as other sports.
