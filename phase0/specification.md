## Sports Agents Application

The Sports Agents Application provides a way for users to 
access statistics about sports, compare players and teams, 
and form a Fantasy league by placing bets on the outcomes of future
matches. 

Specifications: 

The app will consider several sports, currently hockey and tennis.
Its performance will be similar across each sport, only with 
different statistics in each.

Users can upload data on sports players and teams either
manually through the command line, through a file, or by 
accessing data from the web via an API (to be implemented 
in the future). This data will be stored for future querying,
examination, or computations. Users will be able to examine the 
stored data in detail 
through the app. In addition to examining statistics for 
players and teams individually, they can compare players 
and teams with each other.

The user of the app can register members of their fantasy league.
This fantasy league will concern predicting the outcomes of
upcoming matches, which the user must input.
On behalf of these members, the user can make predictions (called
bets) on the outcome of upcoming matches. Each member will
have a history of their correct bets and incorrect bets. In the
future, this will allow rankings within the league as members
compete with each other to make the most correct predictions.

In the future, the application will use a mathematical model
(such as linear regression)
to predict the future performance of a player or team, enhancing
the program's user's ability to predict bets. 
Users will also be able to export the data and later predictions 
to a spreadsheet or other file format.
